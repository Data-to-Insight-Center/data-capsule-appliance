As part of the project at the [Data to Insight Center](https://pti.iu.edu/centers/d2i/index.html){:target="_blank"} supported by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (#LG-71-17-0094-17), we are working on automating the Data Capsule service to enable computational access to restricted collections in libraries and archives. This service has been developed as part of the [HathiTrust Research Center](https://pti.iu.edu/centers/htrc/index.html){:target="_blank"} to provide computational non-consumptive access to the HathiTrust Digital Library. Converted into an appliance, the Data Capsule can be deployed and used in other settings.

Our team is working with partners from the University of Virginia, Universities of California Berkeley and Los Angeles, Swarthmore College and others to gather information about ease-of-use of the setup as well as the challenges of connecting data capsules to digital collections.
